# EC Scholar Net 🎓📡

**EC Scholar Net** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to assist Electronics and Communication Engineering students with academic and project-related resources. Developed as a final-year project, this platform serves as a one-stop hub for learning, simulation, collaboration, and component purchasing.

## 📌 Project Overview

EC Scholar Net aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation by providing:

- Detailed component information
- Subject-wise notes
- Final-year project ideas and documentation
- Circuit simulation references
- A simple AI chatbot for student queries
- A student chatroom for peer discussions
- An online component store (EC Net Store)
